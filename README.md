# WAA-project

# Deployement 
I choose to deploy on Heroku : 
here is the link to my app : https://projectwaa.herokuapp.com/
You can then choose the assignement that you want 

# 1Assignement : (5pts)
I choose my own multiuser whiteboard.
You can draw but also display figures.

I add a button in the menubar to open image in a new tab and to display it in a new image tag below the live canvas.

Anti-Bug
- if you don't enter a name : alert -> enter a name
- if options of figures are empty : figures are not drawn

# 3Assignement : (10pts)
I choose the movie : Superman/Batman: Apocalypse

You can test the app with : 
- the director : Lauren Montgomery / 2 films : wonder woman / hulk vs. thor
- an actor : Michael Uslan / 3 films : the lego movie / joker / chase me

Anti-Bug
- if the movie enter is the same as the movie of the beginning (Superman/Batman: Apocalypse) : alert -> can't choose this one
- if a movie is enter twice : wrong answer (title already enter)
- case insensitive for name of actors/director/movies
- if input empty = alert -> enter un name/film
